# respublica
**res publica**: *Latin*, public affair. See *republic*.

The law is a public affair. So why can't we understand it for ourselves? What if
we could?

This is a highly experimental work to parse, simplify, and shorten the U.S. Code
to make it human-friendly. I have absolutely no idea how to accomplish this, but
I have a few ideas:

- Building computer language parsers for legal definitions
- Parsing the U.S. code for machine-friendly models, like [uscode][uscode]
- Adapting existing language bots, like [autotldr][autotldr]
- Training machine learning models for shortening text

## Usage

Install dependencies with [pipenv][pipenv]:
```
$ pipenv install
```

API WIP.
